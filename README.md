This Qt repository was developed using OpenCV. The main goal was to play with Qt and to experiment / implement computer vision algorithms.

* SLIC superpixel algorithm (http://ivrl.epfl.ch/research/superpixels) was implemented.

* Several images transition algorithms were implemented. They support gray scale images and three channel images.

* GPU support and CPU only super resolution were experimented.

* A Qt interface was implemented. It supports opening a file, invoking the image transition algorithms and SLIC superpixel algorithm in the opened image.
